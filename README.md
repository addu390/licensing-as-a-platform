# licensing-as-a-platform `Work In Progress 🚧`
licensing-as-a-service/licensing-as-a-platform (LaaS)

#### Project goal 🚀:
- A profile store of users/customers.
- Licensing as a service.

If you are an independent software vendor (ISV) or software publisher you will most likely want to monetize the software application you have developed. The terms under which you provide your software to a customer is defined by the software license — how much the customer has to pay, for how long, which versions of your application does their license apply to, etc 🚁
